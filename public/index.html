    <h1>Things to consider when buying a new pair of skates</h1>

    <p>
      A hobby I picked up this past year is rollerblading. Rollerblading is
      quite fun and can be great exercise. Choosing the right pair of skates is
      very important in getting the most our of your skating experience.
    </p>

      Choosing the right pair of skates is paramount. There is some homework to
      do before you get your first pair. One key aspect of finding the right
      pair of skates is deciding between four wheels and three.
    </p>
    <p>
      A four wheel setup will give you more stability but less agility. A four
      wheel setup will also help in acceleration more so than a three wheel
      setup because you have on extra point of contact with the ground to get
      going. A three wheel setup will have less stability but more agility
      because with three wheels you will have a shorter frame. As previously
      mentioned, a four wheel setup will have better acceleration, but a three
      wheel setup will maintain top speed more efficiently since there is one
      less contact point to the ground to slow you down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number of wheels is just one decision you have to make when buying the
      right pair of skates. Frame size/height, shell material, and wheel size
      are other things to consider when purchasing a pair of skates. If you give
      it a go and carefully decide on the right pair, tons of fun awaits!
